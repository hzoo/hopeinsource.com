season: 5
date: 2025-05-30
time: "100"
description: "Laurel and I take a stroll through Central park on Memorial day: chatting about the idea of a sauntercast (a walking podcast), voice notes, memory, the romance of distance, physicality, screenshots, printers, embodiment, energy, perception, ultralight, ordinary time. I certainly felt both the messiness and the surprise of being outside! "
