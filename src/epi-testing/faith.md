#### What is your faith background?

[00:00] **Nadia**: So we decided to start recording some conversations about open source and faith, because both of us have noticed in our work around open source, there are a lot of open source developers that had some sort of connection to faith. Often, Christian faith. Both of us were sort of wondering why that was. We have pretty different backgrounds in terms of our personal connection to faith. Henry, do you want to talk a little bit about yours first and then I'll talk about mine?

[00:29] **Henry**: Yeah, real short, I am a Christian. I didn't grow up Christian but I mostly started pursuing it after college and going into working. I've just noticed through getting involved in open source, just a lot of parallels with what we do in church and our faith background. I didn't hear a lot of people talking about it but it does seem like it's kind of underlying a lot of stuff. So it would be really interesting to talk more about it explicitly.

[01:05] **Nadia**: I'm not religious, but I guess I've had a background of just being maybe more like academically interested in it since I don't even know when. I went to a Quaker high school which was definitely really influential for me. Quakers have a really strong background in public service, community service, activism, and things like that. So that definitely has fed into my understanding of faith and religion and community.

#### Faith as restorative

[01:39] **Nadia**: I guess I'm sort of weirdly interested in this topic because it's just fascinated me that especially for me working in tech in San Francisco, I feel like I almost never interact with faith or religion among my peers at all, in my sort of geographic location. But it seems like in open source for some reason, it's a much more prominent theme.

[46:08] **Henry**: I guess we could just end it there.

[46:10] **Nadia**: Yeah, I enjoyed having this conversation.

[46:13] **Henry**: Yeah. Thanks! Please get Nadia's book!

[46:16] **Nadia**: Oh yeah. I should probably say that, buy my book.

[46:18] **Henry**: Working in Public.

[46:20] **Nadia**: Yes. Working in Public. It's available now.

[46:23] **Henry**: Alright, cool. Thanks for coming on this.

[46:25] **Nadia**: Thanks for having me.
