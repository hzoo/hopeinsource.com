# Transcript Cleanup Guide

Rules for cleaning podcast transcripts. Goal: readable text that preserves authentic voice. The audio is the source of truth — the transcript should read well without changing what was said.

## What to remove

### Pure filler words
- **um, uh, ah** — remove when they add nothing
- **like** — remove when purely filler ("I was like, like, really into it" → "I was really into it")
- Repeated/stuttered words ("I I think" → "I think")

### Obvious deadweight phrases
Only when clearly adding nothing to the sentence:
- "you know" (as verbal tic, not genuine question)
- "I mean" (as throat-clearing, not clarification)
- "basically" (when it precedes something that isn't a simplification)
- "sort of / kind of" — only when completely empty; often these hedge meaningfully

### Run-on connectors
- Trim **"And so" / "But so" / "And then" / "And also"** at sentence starts when they're just momentum filler, not doing logical work
- Especially when they stack: "And so, and then, and also..." → just start the sentence
- Keep when the connector genuinely signals cause/effect or sequence

### Redundant hedge stacks
- When multiple hedges pile up before a thought, keep one, drop the rest
- "I think maybe sort of kind of" → "I think maybe" or "sort of"
- The goal is one hedge per thought — enough tentativeness without the stutter

### False starts (expanded)
- Trim more aggressively when the speaker takes 2-3 tries to start: "I just, I feel like I've, for me, like a..." → keep only the version they land on
- Still preserve self-corrections that reveal thinking or are interesting in themselves

## What to keep

### Hedging and approximation
- **"like" as hedge** — "It felt like... almost like a church?" — the tentativeness is authentic, keep it
- **"like" as simile** — always keep ("it's like a community thing")
- **"sort of / kind of"** — keep when doing real hedging or approximation work
- **"right?" as tag question** — keep when checking in with the listener

### Self-corrections and false starts
- **Case by case.** Trim if pure noise (stuttering into a sentence). Keep if the correction itself is interesting or reveals the thinking process.
- "I think — well, actually no — the real issue is..." → keep if the reversal matters, trim if it's just a restart

### Emotional / vulnerable moments
- **Leave completely untouched.** When someone stumbles because the topic is hard — hesitations, restarts, trailing off — that's meaning, not filler.

### Grammar
- **Never fix grammar.** Spoken grammar stays as-is. Don't correct "me and Nadia was talking" or sentence fragments.
- **Do fix transcription errors** — wrong homophones, garbled names, clearly mis-heard words.

## Principles

1. **Subtractive only.** Remove filler, never rewrite or rephrase.
2. **When in doubt, leave it.** Better to keep something slightly noisy than to lose voice.
3. **Read the sentence aloud after editing.** If removing the filler changes the rhythm or emphasis in a way that feels wrong, put it back.
4. **Context matters.** The same word ("like", "you know") can be filler in one sentence and load-bearing in another. Judge per instance.
